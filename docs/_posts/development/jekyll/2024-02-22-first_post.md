**Creating the file**
Start by creating a file in ./docs/_posts/...

The file format has to be ```yyyy-mm-dd-name_of_file.md```

**Header**
Now start with the title.

For that create a header like
```markdown
---
title: "Any title"
---
```
Read more about headers in [jekyll_headers]({% post_url 2024-02-22-jekyll_headers %})

Save the file and thats it. Your first post is finished
